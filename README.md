WG Bars is a webapp that lets you keep track of items being bought in a WG.

The tables in the Database are:

The Users table is the table storing the WG members.
The Id is the primary key and it's auto generated.

#### ITEM
|ID|Name|
|---|---|
|1|Toilet Paper|


The Items table stores different items.
The Id is the primary key and it's auto generated.

#### BOUGHT_BY
|ID|User_Id|Item_Id|Date|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|1|1|2020-05-04|

The Bought_by table connects each user with the items that they've bought.
